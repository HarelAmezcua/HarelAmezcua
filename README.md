ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing advanced algorithms for autonomous navigation and decision-making in unpredictable environments.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m on a continual learning path, currently diving deeper into the realms of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and advanced computer vision techniques.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to make a significant impact in robotics, especially those that bridge the gap between theory and practical application.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking challenges that push the limits of current robotic systems in terms of autonomy, adaptability, and intelligence.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to robotics, machine learning, motion planning, SLAM, or computer vision. I'm always excited to discuss new ideas and share knowledge!
